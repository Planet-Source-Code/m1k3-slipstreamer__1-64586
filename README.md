### Description

Windows XP, 2000, 2003[Server], Office XP and 2003 can be "slipstreamed" or made to have the latest service pack integrated before installation. This is an 'almost finished' project that completes the operation by tab-to-tab selection in the GUI. Although not well commented, most of the code is straightforeward and easily deduced. If I get a few votes on this, I'll try to finish it in it's entirety and post updates(s).
